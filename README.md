* Cracking Hill Cipher		
   * If the ciphertext is known and a part of the plaintext and its position is known. there is a chance to be able to decrypt the ciphertext given the size of plaintext is sufficient to cover the dimensions of the key matrix

* Weak Exponent Attack on RSA
   * The ciphertext resulting from the RSA encrytion of a message using a weak exponent can easily be recovered. This is possible when N is so large that the message powered to the exponent is still smaller than N, therefore requiring a exponenth root of the ciphertext to retrieve the plaintext
